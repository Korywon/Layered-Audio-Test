# Layered-Audio-Test
This is my "test bench" for playing around with layered music. It is a component of what is to be included within my homework 8 final project.

Takes input as number of levels to increase by. All music (except TetrisFinal.wav) was composed by me. TetrisFinal.wav came from Super Smash Bros. Brawl's Tetris A.asdfasdfasdf
