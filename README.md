# Layered-Audio-Test
This is my "test bench" for playing around with layered music. It is a component of what is to be included within my homework 8 final project.

Takes input as number of levels to increase by. All music (except TetrisFinal.wav) were composed by me. TetrisFinal.wav came from Super Smash Bros. Brawl's Tetris A.

- Level 1: No Music
- Level 2 to Level 9: Tetris B
- Level 9 to Level 17: Tetris A
- Level 18: Tetris: Type A (Super Smash Bros Brawl)
